The PPCI (Pure Python Compiler Infrastructure) project is a compiler
written entirely in the Python programming
language. It contains front-ends for various programming languages as
well as machine code generation functionality. With this library you can
generate (working!) machine code using Python (and thus very easy to
explore, extend, etc.)!
