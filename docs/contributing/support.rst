=======

Ppci is still in development, and all help is welcome!

How to help
-----------

If you want to add some code to the project, the best way is
to create a fork of the project, make your changes and create a pull
request. You can also help to improve the documentation if you find
something that is not clear.

For a list of tasks, refer to :doc:`the todo page<todo>`. For help on
getting started with
development see :doc:`the development page<development>`.

How to submit a patch
---------------------

This section explains how to add something to ppci.

1. Clone the repository at bitbucket to your own account.
2. Communicate via e-mail / chat the change you wish to make.
3. Create a hg bookmark, not a branch, and make your change. Make sure you
   use the default branch.
4. Create a pull request.
